# Doctor's Appointments

This is a Doctor's Appointment application that is intended to show some of the skills of a full-stack web developer that uses Ruby on Rails and React.

**Doctor's appointments** is a an API tied to a frontend written in react, made using the methodology and indications of the Capstone Project provided by [Microverse](https://microverse.org). This project ask us to make a industry level application to show some of the skills learnt during the course.

## Doctors App Features

To view the live demo, click the [Doctor's App link](https://doctorscapstone.herokuapp.com/). You will be taken to the login page. There, you will be able to register as a new user. You may also log in using  `carlos@email.com` as your email and `foobar` as the password.

Once you log in, you will be taken to the homepage. As this is a partial implementation, only the nav bar and the Doctorâ€™s button are currently available.

Click on Doctor and behold the doctor search bar! There, you can select a specialty and the corresponding doctors will be filtered and displayed for you. Select the doctor that you prefer.

Once you select your desired doctor, you will then be able to see information and feedback about the doctor and clinic. If you are happy with your selection, you can click on **Book Appointment**.

The most important and elaborate part of this application is the booking system, in which every doctor has a totally independent set of available appointments. You can choose the date and time for the appointment and click Book. You will then be taken to a confirmation window and voila: your appointment is arranged.

The nicest feature about this implementation is that the selected appointment will no longer be available to other users.

Once your appointment has been set, you can then go to the main men and check your booked appointments.

# Future Features

In the original design of this application are other modules that could be developed as the one for requiring an ambulance, or buying medication, I definitely want to implement those features.

I would like to implement a feature in which doctors can register and open their appointments, keep track of their patients and register a clinic history, as there is feedback commenting for the users to grade the doctor's service I think is important that doctors grade and register the behavior of the patients as well as theirs discipline if they recomend a diet or taking timely the medication.
